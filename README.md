# About 

This is my first project on my own. Even dough the game idea is not mine, I found it very usefull to learn RGB, coding practices, event handlers, flexbox and responsivnes and a tone of JavaScript.

Feel free to post any constuctive critics so I can grow as a developer.

# Notes

This is the first version of the game. I will come back and try incorporate more features and fix some practices.
